# linux-kernel-mpls-adder
A C-based utility for managing MPLS routes in Linux via Netlink, bypassing iproute2 for direct kernel interaction. It allows adding, swapping, and encapsulating MPLS routes, providing precise control for network engineers and developers. Ideal for MPLS forwarding, automation, and low-level networking experiments.
